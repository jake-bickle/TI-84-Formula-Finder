# TI-84-Formula-Finder
Given two points, figures out the mathematical formula for different types of lines and curves. These saved me a lot of time in MTH111 and MTH112


# Installing
You must have a mini (not a micro!) usb to connect your to your calculator. 
Install TI Connect CE at https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw on a desktop or laptop.
Then, using TI Connect CE software, download TPPOINTS and TWOPOINT to your calculator.

If that is not possible (some calculators don't actually have a mini usb port), another (less likely) method is to connect two calculators together with an IO cable to transfer the data over. Of course, this requires that one calculator already has the programs installed. To begin:
1. Press 2ND and STAT to go the LINK menu.
2. On the recieving calculator, simply press right and select "Receive".
3. On the transfering calculator, navigate to PRGM and select TPPOINT and TWOPOINT. 
4. Now, hit right and select "Transmit".


# Usage
To use, simply press "PRGM" on your calculator and find TWOPOINT. Do not use TPPOINTS, as it is a seperate program used by TWOPOINT to gather coordinates. This is seperate to conserve the limited space in your calculator.


# Plans
- Add more curves to find
- Make output simpler
